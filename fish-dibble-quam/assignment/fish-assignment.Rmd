## Cod Collapse Model

This portion of the report references Cod from Canada and United States displayed into a graph to determine the point of collapse in the fish species. This is meant to be a replication of the original study using the data which is referenced in this article

- [Link the the original study](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2542918)

```{r}

library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")

```

```{r}
excel_version <- "RLSADB v4.44/DB Files With Assessment Data/RLSADB v4.44 (assessment data only).xlsx"
if(!file.exists(excel_version)){
  download.file("https://zenodo.org/record/2542919/files/RLSADB%20v4.44.zip?download=1",
                "ramlegacy.zip")
unzip("ramlegacy.zip") 
}
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
#this section will be referenced at the bottom of our assignment as extra useful code chucnks to inspect the data in various ways through different methods 
sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(excel_version) #use the readxl package to identify sheet names 
ram <- lapply(sheets, readxl::read_excel, path = excel_version)  #read the data from all 3 sheets into a list
#read data from 1 sheet

#ram <- map(sheets, read_excel, path = excel_version)

## check your names

    left_join(ram$stock) %>% 
    left_join(ram$area) %>% 
    left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c("tsid" = "tsunique")) %>%
    filter(stockid == "COD2J3KL", #
           country == "USA" | country == "Canada") %>% 
    filter(tsid == "TC-MT") %>% 
    arrange(tsyear) %>% group_by(tsyear) %>%
    summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue)) %>%
    mutate(maxcatch = cummax(total_catch)) %>%
    mutate(collapsed = total_catch < (maxcatch * 0.1)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = tsyear, y = total_catch), na.rm = TRUE) +

    labs( x = "Year", y = "Tons", title = "Fish Landings in Tons") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) 
   
cod
```

Looking at this graph and starting in 1850 we can see that there is a small unptrend in how many fish landings there were. This trend is modestly increasing until 1950, where there is a significant increase in total catch of the Cod species. This could be due to technological improvements that make it easier to catch and track fish. It may also be attributed to an exponentially increase of human population and total demand of Cod fish. Nontheless, this results in a dramatic increase and then drastic decline in the species, when there should have been major red flags and regulations implimented to prevented any further fishing. It is seen that even with boundaries that were implimented around fishing in the late 1970's we only see a slight uptrend into the early 1990's. After the 1990's the decline begins again and reaches a point where the species can no longer be fished, which results in zero fish landings. Here you can see the decline in species to the point were fishing it was either banned or not feasible. 

```{r}
#Code for simple methods of of filtering and arranging data. 

count(ram$stock) %>% arrange(n) 

ram$timeseries %>% count(tsid) %>% arrange(tsid)

ram$tsmetrics %>% filter(tscategory == "CATCH or LANDINGS") %>% distinct() 
    
#ram$tsmetrics %>% select(tsunique) %>% distinct() %>% arrange()
#ram$timeseries %>% select(tsid) %>% distinct() %>% arrange()

#we want year and fish landings in tons in order to get the right graphs

ram$tsmetrics %>% filter(tscategory == "CATCH or LANDINGS") #%>% count(tslong)

#ram$timeseries_values_views %>% 
  #filter(tsn == "164712")

  ram$area
ram$area %>% count(country)

## Stock Collapses as a whole 

In this portion of the study we are aiming to replicate the model displayed below
![](http://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/worm2006.jpg)

Our goal is to replicate this study by Worm using the following data
- [Link to study ](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294)

```{r}
#new task requires getting all of the species
#use a group_by function instead of filter 
#group by scientificname, tsyear 
#then use a summarise function
#we need a column for collapsed taxa
#upper lines mean fish got out of the collapse 
#lower lines mean fish did not recover and collapsed
#you need to know how many taxa you have to decide a % of collapsed missing

cod <-
    ram$timeseries %>% 
    left_join(ram$stock) %>% 
    left_join(ram$area) %>% 
    left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c("tsid" = "tsunique")) %>%
    filter(stockid == "COD2J3KL", 
           country == "USA" | country == "Canada") %>% 
    filter(tsid == "TC-MT") %>% 
    arrange(tsyear) %>% group_by(tsyear) %>%
    summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue)) %>%
    mutate(maxcatch = cummax(total_catch)) %>%
    mutate(collapsed = total_catch < (maxcatch * 0.1)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = tsyear, y = total_catch), na.rm = TRUE) +
    geom_line() +
    labs( x = "Year", y = "Tons", title = "Fish Landings in Tons") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)

fish <-
    ram$timeseries %>% 
    left_join(ram$stock) %>% 
    left_join(ram$area) %>% 
    left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c("tsid" = "tsunique")) %>%
    filter(tsid == "TC-MT") %>% 
    arrange(tsyear) %>% 
    group_by(tsn, tsyear) %>%
    summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(maxcatch = cummax(total_catch)) %>%
    mutate(collapsed = total_catch < (maxcatch * 0.1)) %>%
    mutate(indicator = collapsed * 1) %>%
    group_by(tsyear) 
   
collapsed_fish <-
  fish %>% filter(collapsed == TRUE) %>%
    summarize(total = n())  

total_fish <- 
  fish %>% summarise(total_count = n())

fish_plot <-
  left_join(collapsed_fish, total_fish) %>%
  mutate(percent = total/ total_count * 100)
  
fish_plot

  ggplot(filter(fish_plot, tsyear > 1950 & tsyear < 2017), 
    aes(x = tsyear, y = percent), na.rm = TRUE) +
    geom_point() + 
    scale_y_reverse()+
    labs( x = "Year", y = "Total Taxa (%)", title = "Species collapsing over time") +
    theme_minimal()
   
```

We wanted to created a true/ false column for species that collapsed here. It is evident when searching the data that every species didn't collapse in 1800's. Although the goal was to create a marker for species to show that if it collapsed then it stayed collapsed thorugh the end of the data. We struggled with this concept becuase understanding how many species there truly were was hard to justify in code itself. 

Our approach created a plot that showed the decline in cod species relative to the total number of species in the data tables. We were able to create a True and False column of when species collapsed however it was not 100% accurate according to how Worm concluded the data. 

Part of the problem here is that we wanted to know every species that had been overfished into oblivion from 1850 and what percent relative to all species were collapsing. We were able to see this from 1950 but dates prior made it very difficult to seperate which taxa had declined fully and which haven't. This came down to a simple coding understanding. Despite the barrier of understanding it is still clear that looking at individual species, as is vaugely shown in this graph, there is a sharp decline leading to a collapse.
